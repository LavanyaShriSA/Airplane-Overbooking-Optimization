Problem Description:
The objective is to determine the optimal number of overbooked passengers and the global maximum
revenue value in order to maximize the airline's revenue. We can consider this as an optimization
problem and the objective is to find the global maximum point since we need to find the point of
maximum revenue. The optimum number of seats that can be overbooked is the number of overbooked
seats at the global maximum point.
